# Face-Recognition

Applied K Nearest Neighbour classification algorithm in face recognition using opencv and HaarCascades CNN model for frontal face detection. 
Tech Stack - Python, ML(KNN), OpenCV.
Initially, the name and frames of human face are collected and stored as .npy file.
Later, the main model(KNN) will be executed and it displays the name of the human as soon as the face is detected.
