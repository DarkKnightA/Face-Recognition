# Face-Recognition

This project is built for face recognition using K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN).
The classifier used for detecting face is Haarcascades Classifier.
Initially, the name and frames of human face are collected and stored as .npy file.
Later, the main model(KNN) will be executed and it displays the name of the human as soon as the face is detected.
